# Angular1

## Description
This is my first porject in Angular language. It is part of my stauding path in start2impact university.This project uses the https://gorest.co.in/ API and allows you to view users, posts, leave comments on each post and create new users and new posts. To login, you need to log in to https://gorest.co.in/consumer/login and get your private key. To remedy the lack of a real login (the APIs do not offer this service) a new user is created at each login (otherwise it would be impossible to create new posts).
