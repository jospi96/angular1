# Angular1

This is my first porject in Angular language. It is part of my stauding path in start2impact university.

# Development
This single page application is developed in angular and it is splited in eight component and two service.

## Login Componet
The login component is the first view of my project on this page you need to enter your name, email and key to access the site's features. This component creates a user every time because it was not possible to login in the API specifications. At the design level, the component is a data form (ngForm) which is then used to create a user thanks to the API, the user is saved in the localstorage and can then be used in all sections of the site.

## Dashboard component
This is the main component, here is the menu, with the sidebar for accessing the various sections of the site and the button for logging out.
The sidebar is developed with Angular Material.
